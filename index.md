## Rationale

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies in artificial intelligence. In recent years, NLP applications in Medicine are everywhere because large quantities of free-text information stored in databases are waiting to be explored. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to NLP applications and cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP.

## Logistics

* **Lectures**: 5:00-8:00 pm East Time on Wednesdays (online)
* **Lecture videos for enrolled students**: are posted on XXXX (requires login) shortly after each lecture ends. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make these videos viewable by non-enrolled students. 
* **Email office hours**: 
  * I will respond to student email messages between 4:00 and 5:00 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
* **Office hours**:
  * **Time**: 4:00-5:00 pm on Mondays, or by appointment.
  * **Attending remotely**: I will send you a zoom chat link during office hours.
  * **Contact**: Students should ask all course-related questions in the XXXX, where you will also find announcements. For external inquiries, emergencies, or personal matters that you don't wish to put in a private XXXX, you can email me at yip4002@med.cornell.edu.

### Goals

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies in artificial intelligence. In recent years, NLP applications in Medicine are everywhere because large quantities of free-text information stored in databases (such as Electronic Medical Records, biomedical literature, and clinical trials) are waiting to be explored. NLP helps the computers understand human written language and thus extract biomedical information from free text. 

In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to NLP applications and cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments, and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their NLP models.

### Prerequisites

* **Python**: Prior exposure to programming and Python is highly recommended. We will provide a tutorial on Python in the first two weeks.
* **Basic Probability and Statistics**: You should know the basics of probabilities, mean, standard deviation, etc.
* **College Calculus, Linear Algebra**: You should understand matrix/vector notation and operations.

### Reference Texts

The following texts are useful, but none are required.

## Coursework

### Participation (35%)

We appreciate everyone being actively involved in the class! There are several ways of earning participation credit:

* **Attending two random lectures**: 
  * At two randomly-selected (non-guest) lectures in the quarter, we will take attendance. You will get 5% per lecture (10% total). 
  * If you miss these two lectures, you can get 2.5% per lecture (5% total) by writing a ‘reaction paragraph’.
* **Attending guest speakers' lectures**: 
  * In the second half of the class, we have three invited speakers. Our guest speakers make a significant effort to come lecture for us, so we do not want them lecturing to a largely empty room.
  * You will get 5% per lecture (15% total). 
  * If you miss these two lectures, you can get 2.5% per lecture (7.5% total) by writing a ‘reaction paragraph’.
* **Completing feedback surveys**: We will send out two feedback surveys (mid-quarter and end-of-quarter) to help us understand how the course is going, and how we can improve. You can get 5% for each survey (10% total).

### Assignments (30%)

There are three weekly assignments, which will improve both your theoretical understanding and your practical skills. All assignments contain written questions.

* **Credit**: Each is worth 10% (30% total)
* **Deadlines**: All assignments are due on Wednesday before class (i.e., before 5:00 pm).
* **Submission**: TBD
* **Collaboration**: Study groups are allowed, but students must understand and complete their own assignments, and hand in one assignment per student. If you worked in a group, please put the names of the members of your study group at the top of your assignment.

### Final project (20%)

The Final Project offers you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth application. Students have two options: the Default Final Project (in which students tackle a predefined task, namely textual Question Answering) or a Custom Final Project (in which students choose their own project involving human language). 

#### Important information

* **Credit**: For both default and custom projects, credit for the final project is broken down as follows: 
  * Project proposal (5%) [instructions] 
  * Project oral presentation (5%) [instructions] 
  * Project report (10%) [instructions] 
* **Deadlines**: The project proposal and report are all due at 5:00 pm. All deadlines are listed in the schedule.
* **Default Final Project**: In this project, students explore deep learning solutions to the SQuAD (Stanford Question Asking Dataset) challenge. This year's project is similar to last year's, on SQuAD 2.0 with baseline code in PyTorch. 

#### Practicalities

* **Team size**: Students may do final projects solo, or in teams of up to 2 people. We strongly recommend you do the final project in a team. 
* **Contribution**: In the final report we ask for a statement of what each team member contributed to the project. Team members will typically get the same grade, but we may differentiate in extreme cases of unequal contribution. You can contact us in confidence in the event of unequal contribution.
* **External collaborators**: You can work on a project that has external (non CS224n student) collaborators, but you must make it clear in your final report which parts of the project were your work.
* **Sharing projects**: You can share a single project between CS224n and another class, but we expect the project to be accordingly bigger, and you must declare that you are sharing the project in your project proposal.
* **Using external resources**: The following guidelines apply to all projects (though the default project has some more specific rules, provided in the Honor Code section of the handout): 
  * You may use any existing code, libraries, etc. and consult and any papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your writeup and clearly indicate which parts of the project are your contribution and which parts were implemented by others.
  * Under no circumstances may you look at another CS224n group’s code, or incorporate their code into your project.


### Late days

If you didn’t inform me before (see details below), the penalty is 1% off the final grand for each additional late day.

It is understood that illnesses, work or family obligations, and other unexpected issues may occur. If you have an issue that will cause you to be unable to submit an assignment on time or is impacting your ability to participate actively in the course, please notify me by email as early as possible so that we can work out alternative arrangements. In general, the earlier you inform me about issues, the more options we have available to us, so please do not hesitate to inform me about any issues that are impacting your ability to successfully participate in the course and complete your work. I strongly encourage you to communicate with me, and I am committed to finding solutions that will enable you to be successful in the course (within the framework of program policies). However, the longer you wait to communicate with me, the more our options will be constrained by program policies.
If you are having difficulty organizing your workload and making a schedule for yourself, please contact me for advice and assistance.

### Regrade Requests

If you feel you deserved a better grade on an assignment, you may contact me within 3 days after the grades are released. Your request should briefly summarize why you feel the original grade was unfair. I will reevaluate your assignment as soon as possible, and then issue a decision.
