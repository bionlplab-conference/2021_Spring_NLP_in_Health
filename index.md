## Rationale

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies in artificial intelligence. In recent years, NLP applications in Medicine are everywhere because large quantities of free-text information stored in databases (such as Electronic Medical Records, biomedical literature, and clinical trials) are waiting to be explored. NLP helps the computers understand human written language and thus extract biomedical information from free text.

## Course Aims and Outcomes

### Aims

This course provides students with an understanding of the field of natural language processing and its applications in health. Students will acquire knowledge of sources of text data, linguistic structures, and the range of methods available for processing. Hands-on experience with the Python programming language and tool kit will provide useful skills for managing text data for solving a variety of problems in the health domain.

### Specific Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Describe different applications of natural language processing in health.
* Identify sources of unstructured data (corpora).
* Analyze unstructured data in terms of linguistic structures.
* Apply pre-processing methods to prepare unstructured data for analysis.
* Define different kinds of structural and statistical features of unstructured data and apply methods for extracting them.
* Explain the differences and indications for rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, and apply methods from each approach to solve problems.
* Compare different methods using evaluation metrics.
* Complete language processing tasks using the Python language and tool kits.

## Format and Procedures

The course is 15 weeks in length. The course follows the progression of topics: python review, regular expression and automata, text normalization, n-gram, text classification, sequence labeling, parsing, word vector, introduction to deep learning, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, and transformer-based method. Each topic is addressed in a module lasting 1-2 weeks. Students will work on an individual project in parallel with these activities and give a final presentation last week.

Students are expected to attend every lecture on zoom. Students must notify the instructor about any planned absence and present a plan for completion of any work missed. Student participation in lectures is highly encouraged. Students should complete all homework assignments individually, using their own words. The final project should be completed in a team of up to 2 people, and result in a polished, professional final presentation.

## My Assumptions

This is a graduate-level course that expects a high level of independence and creativity. As an introductory course in a complex field, many topics can only be touched on in a superficial way. Homework will require reflection and analysis. The final project may require exploration of methods before they are discussed in class. Therefore, students are encouraged to read ahead and investigate other sources of information to guide their work.

In this course, the emphasis is placed on your active engagement with the course material and with the other members of the learning environment. We will guide and support you through the course, but the onus will be on you to take responsibility for your learning.

The course is designed for understanding primary concepts of machine learning and text mining, and more importantly, having in-depth practice on these topics. It will require you to draw connections among these main topics; critically analyze, evaluate, and reflect upon course concepts; synthesize course concepts; and apply the course concepts in novel ways. For these topics, having hands-on experience is essential; you should be able to develop primary text mining applications on your own after completing the course. The course materials will enable you to develop progressively more advanced learning skills while obtaining feedback that will allow you to make adjustments and improvements – in other words, to become a self-regulated learner. It is important to be self-aware and to know our learning preferences. If you are not a self-directed, active learner, then that is ok – but this course might not be the best fit for you. Please contact me with your questions or concerns about the learning philosophy for this course.

### Participation (25%)

We appreciate everyone being actively involved in the class! There are several ways of earning participation credit:

* **Attending two random lectures** (10% total): 
  * At two randomly-selected (non-guest) lectures in the quarter, we will take attendance. You will get 5% per lecture. 
  * If you miss these two lectures, you can get 2.5% per lecture (5% total) by writing a ‘reaction paragraph’.
* **Attending guest speakers' lectures** (15% total) : 
  * In the second half of the class, we have three invited speakers. Our guest speakers make a significant effort to come lecture for us, so we do not want them lecturing to a largely empty room.
  * You will get 2.5% per lecture. 

### Assignments (30%)

There are three weekly assignments, which will improve both your theoretical understanding and your practical skills. All assignments contain written questions.

* **Credit**: Each is worth 10% (30% total)
* **Deadlines**: All assignments are due on Wednesday before class (i.e., before 5:00 pm).
* **Submission**: TBD
* **Collaboration**: Study groups are allowed, but students must understand and complete their own assignments, and hand in one assignment per student. If you worked in a group, please put the names of the members of your study group at the top of your assignment.

### Final project (45%)

The Final Project offers you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth application. Students have two options: the Default Final Project (in which students tackle a predefined task, namely textual Question Answering) or a Custom Final Project (in which students choose their own project involving human language). 

#### Important information

* **Credit**: For both default and custom projects, credit for the final project is broken down as follows: 
  * Literature review (15%)
  * Project oral presentation (10%)
  * Project report (20%)
* **Deadlines**: The project proposal and report are all due at 5:00 pm. All deadlines are listed in the schedule.
* **Default Final Project**: In this project, students explore NLP solutions to one of the BLUE benchmark tasks.

#### Practicalities

* **Team size**: Students may do final projects solo, or in teams of up to 2 people. We strongly recommend you do the final project in a team. 
* **Contribution**: In the final report we ask for a statement of what each team member contributed to the project. Team members will typically get the same grade, but we may differentiate in extreme cases of unequal contribution. You can contact us in confidence in the event of unequal contribution.
* **External collaborators**: You can work on a project that has external (non CS224n student) collaborators, but you must make it clear in your final report which parts of the project were your work.
* **Sharing projects**: You can share a single project between CS224n and another class, but we expect the project to be accordingly bigger, and you must declare that you are sharing the project in your project proposal.
* **Using external resources**: The following guidelines apply to all projects (though the default project has some more specific rules, provided in the Honor Code section of the handout): 
  * You may use any existing code, libraries, etc. and consult and any papers, books, online references, etc. for your project. However, you must cite your sources in your writeup and clearly indicate which parts of the project are your contribution and which parts were implemented by others.
  * Under no circumstances may you look at another CS224n group’s code, or incorporate their code into your project.


### Late days

If you didn’t inform me before (see details below), the penalty is 1% off the final grand for each additional late day.

It is understood that illnesses, work or family obligations, and other unexpected issues may occur. If you have an issue that will cause you to be unable to submit an assignment on time or is impacting your ability to participate actively in the course, please notify me by email as early as possible so that we can work out alternative arrangements. In general, the earlier you inform me about issues, the more options we have available to us, so please do not hesitate to inform me about any issues that are impacting your ability to successfully participate in the course and complete your work. I strongly encourage you to communicate with me, and I am committed to finding solutions that will enable you to be successful in the course (within the framework of program policies). However, the longer you wait to communicate with me, the more our options will be constrained by program policies.

If you are having difficulty organizing your workload and making a schedule for yourself, please contact me for advice and assistance.

### Regrade Requests

If you feel you deserved a better grade on an assignment, you may contact me within 3 days after the grades are released. Your request should briefly summarize why you feel the original grade was unfair. I will reevaluate your assignment as soon as possible, and then issue a decision. 

## Academic Integrity

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity.  Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work.

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in the lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an email, an email attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

## Accommodations for students with disabilities

In compliance with the Cornell University policy and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for students with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first three weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be made. Students are encouraged to register with Student Disability Services to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.

## Inclusivity Statement

We understand that our members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. The Health Informatics program is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community, we ask all members to:

* Share their unique experiences, values, and beliefs.
* Be open to the views of others.
* Honor the uniqueness of their colleagues.
* Appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community.
* Value each other's opinions and communicate in a respectful manner.
* Keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature.
* Use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in this course and across the Cornell community.
